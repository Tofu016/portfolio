            <p> I consider photography and videography to be the two most significant aspects of my life. 
                I have three years of photography experience and two years of videography experience. 
                I'm passionate about using my camera to record moments and make memories. 
                I enjoy experimenting with various looks and methods, and I'm constantly searching for 
                fresh challenges to push my artistic limits.
            </p>
            <p> I have a strong interest in aviation and enjoy taking pictures of aircraft and enjoy 
                taking pictures of landscapes, people, and events. I am always looking for new 
                opportunities to improve my skills and learn from others in the field.
