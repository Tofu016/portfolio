        <div class="about">
            <p>I am Cristopher Pondoc, a student at St. Dominic College of Asia and currently an undergraduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
            I am also a photographer, videographer, and can do casual and professional edits. I can design, animate, and develop websites. You can rely on me for 
            front-end development programming.</p>

            <p>I aspire to be a front-end developer with skillsets acquired through learning by example and testing my abilities to the fullest.
            With languages like C, Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, I can create and design websites that are attractive and functional. 
            I am a fast learner and can pick up complex concepts with ease. Additionally, I am proficient in Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, and Android Studio as my IDEs. 
            You can check out my work in my <a href="assets/html/portfolio/frontpage.html">portfolio</a>.</p>
